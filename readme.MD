steps

 git init (so you have a locallly initialised repo)
 git status (to verify if all the files are untracked yet as they should)
 git add . (this adds all the files to the git index)
 git commit -m "<msg>"  - this indicates the commit message you want

 after these steps all the files should be commited for this round, before you add more value to the repo. At that point, you should do another commit.
